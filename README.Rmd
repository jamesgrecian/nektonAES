This repository contains code and data for the analysis of Southern Ocean micronekton distributions and forms part of the [ANTSIE](https://antsie.webspace.durham.ac.uk) project.

The outputs from this analysis contribute to the manuscript "Protecting climate refugia to strengthen Southern Ocean resilience"
